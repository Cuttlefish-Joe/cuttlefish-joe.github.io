    <title>Overview : Seismic Interferometry</title>
    <link>https://cuttlefish-joe.github.io/what-is-interferometry/seismic-vs-optical-interferometry/index.html</link>
    <description>Interferometry, as a technique, refers to getting information from the interference between two recorded wave signals, normally generated from a single source event. Typically, interferometry is able to measure properties with much more precision than standard wave signal measurements from a single event.1 This is due to it relying on a comparison of phases between the two signals, rather than needing precise knowledge of the start and end forms of the signal (information sometimes referred to as “statics”).</description>
