<p>Michelson interferometers
To understand the physical principles behind interferometry, waves must be recognised as objects with phases attached to them. A generic wave E at travelling in time t and direction x can be written mathematically as:</p>
\[ E(x,t) = E_0 e^{i (kx - \omega t)} \]
<p>Where $E_0$ serves as an initial amplitude, k as a spatial frequency, and $\omega$ as a temporal frequency. At a specific value for x and t (a specific location and time), this can be simplified to:</p>
\[ E = E_0 e^{i \phi} \]
<p>Where $\phi$ is known as the phase of the wave. This means, when comparing two waves, one of which travelled some additional distance/time compared to the other, the difference between the two waves can be notated as a phase difference; an additional $e^{i\phi}$ term in the expression of the longer-travelled wave.</p>

<p>In a Michelson interferometer, an initial wave signal (laser beam) is generated at location A. This wave travels to the beamsplitter at B, where part of the wave is reflected and travels length $L_1$, while the rest of the wave is transmitted and travels length $L_2$. These distances are different, and so give the part of the wave that travelled that distance the phases $e^{i\phi_1}$ and $e^{i\phi_2}$ respectively. These wave signals are both reflected off of mirrors at $C_1$ and $C_2$, and are rejoined at the beamsplitter, where they will travel to the receiving surface at D. Here, the optical signals get projected as light upon the surface, and will create circular fringes of light and dark bands, where the two phases interfere constructively (the difference in distances travelled is $n\lambda$ for integer n and wavelength $\lambda$) and destructively (the difference in distances is $(n+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$), respectively. By creating directional disturbances, such as bumping the table closer to one path than the other, the path difference between the two beams can be briefly changed, which manifests as a change in the pattern of fringes appearing on the surface. Seeing a fringe appear (or disappear) indicates the difference in distance between the two paths has changed on the order of the wavelength of the light; on the order of hundreds of nanometres.</p>
<p>Information about the reflectivity of the beamsplitter the signal travelled through can be found by analysing the intensity of the final output beam, though the equipment for doing this was not available for this example. Note that this process assumes a constant wavelength for the wave signal throughout the process. This assumption is held generally across different branches of interferometry.</p>
<hr>
<p>A slowed-down video of the change in fringe patterns upon pressing on the table the interferometer was set up on can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seaac7k1wW0" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Another, showing the change from jumping up and down near the table can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M5ApgLFbP8" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>, and a third showing the change from walking around the table can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_1KXxTp9K4" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>. All three videos show changes to the fringing pattern as the interferometer paths are disturbed. These changes all appear oscillatory, showing the effect of the continued aftershock vibrations through the table on the interferometer distance setup. From this it can be seen that impulses near the source or receivers are able to disturb the travel of the wave signals, creating small changes that are amplified to a much greater precision than would be seen if only looking at one signal &ndash; only observing the reflected or transmitted wavelength, we would not be able to observe changes on the orders of hundreds of nanometres. The changes seen are coming only from the difference in path between the two wave signals, the actual initial state of the system (the initial fringe arrangements and intensity) don&rsquo;t factor into the understanding of the changes taking place.</p>
