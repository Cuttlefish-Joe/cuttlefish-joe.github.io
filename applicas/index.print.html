<p>Seismic interferometry as a technique has an array of applications within geophysics. It is also deeply interlinked with other fields of study, including physics and engineering. In fact, the principles developed theoretically as seismic interferometry (then referring specifically to passive source methods, known as daylight scattering) saw their first successful applications in the field of helioseismology, investigating the internal structure of the sun.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="geophysical-applications">Geophysical Applications</h1>

<h2 id="exploration-applications">Exploration applications</h2>
<p>The main goal of seismic interferometry is creating images of the subsurface structure and properties in an investigated area. This is plainly of interest to exploration geophysicists, who need to identify valuable reservoirs and monitor them as development proceeds. Seismic interferometry can be used for estimating appropriate locations for resources<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, as well as monitoring them during resource extraction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Seismic interferometry can also be used during the extraction stages,  with the waves produced by a tunnel-boring machine processed through the technique in order to improve fracture predictions.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It has also been suggested for use in locating miners trapped after collapse events.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Seismic interferometry is a well-suited tool for these exploration applications, given that any inferences drawn from the data will be later validated if exploration takes place. The technique here is useful as a relatively quick and cheap way of surveying sites in detail, for potential exploration ventures. The miner location application, while an important task, is not as well suited to seismic interferometry. This is because many other noise sources could be active at the same time the technique is used, making the active source data more noisy than desired; as well as the potential for the miners to be unable to reach / operate the stations assigned for interferometric modelling.</p>
<h2 id="mapping-applications">Mapping applications</h2>
<p>Seismic interferometry is also widely applied for creating larger-scale maps of earth&rsquo;s structure, and wave velocity (particularly surface wave velocity, as these waves tend to remain as coherent noise across long surface distances).  This is typically, but not always done with earthquake seismology frameworks. For instance, seismic interferometry is used to predict surface wave signals without the use of a velocity model for the region, which can then be used to filter this data and observe other noise sources as well. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Accurate models of surface wave velocity in an area are also beneficial for earthquake damage-mitigation activities. Seismic interferometry can be applied to micro-earthquake records to determine local geological structures in areas without nearby seismological activity, as well as comparatively cheaply monitor long-term subsurface processes in these areas.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The increasing presence of large (portable) seismometer arrays, able to monitor large areas not typically targeted for observation with relatively high density data, provides an opportunity for passive seismic interferometry on a very large scale.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Alternatively, non-earthquake noise sources such as industrial noise have been used to map wave velocities in an area.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> The benefit of seismic interferometry in these scenarios is their ability to collect data at all; these wide-scale surveys end up providing subsurface structure estimates for regions that would not normally be focused on when using conventional seismic techniques. However, it is then harder to verify these models, which are additionally likely to be of lower quality due to the potentially quite weak signals being analysed. With the large array applications this is mitigated somewhat, due to the huge number of potential signal correlations that can be conducted across the whole array, a strength for seismic interferometry&rsquo;s use with them. Manmade noise sources, though intriguing for use with this technique, remain reasonably location-dependent in their applicability.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other applications</h2>
<p>Seismic interferometry has been applied to visualising specific geological features as well. For instance, it has been successfully used in detecting the Mohorovičić discontinuity (crust-mantle boundary) depth<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, and in detecting a subducting plate.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Here, the technique serves as a source of cheap additional information about geological features, that can be compared to and used to enhance existing datasets from other methodologies. Seismic interferometry has also been used to model and monitor volcanic activity, able to detect changes of 0.1% of the velocity, with a one-day temporal resolution.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> While the velocity resolution is good, the temporal resolution produced in this study means the technique is of limited use as an early-warning system, at its current level of development. Though the technique inherently benefits from longer sampling times, as equipment grows more sensitive this may be able to partially offset the reduction in sampling time required for use as an early-warning system. The technique has also been applied to lunar seismic data, using passive data generated from the thermal gradients induced by the sun on the moon&rsquo;s surface.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> This provides more insight into the very sparse dataset of lunar subsurface measurements, however the signals identified were very weak, the datasets to analyse very limited, and the external knowledge of lunar geology lacking, meaning interpreting this data is made more difficult.</p>

<h1 id="physics-and-engineering-applications">Physics and Engineering Applications</h1>

<h2 id="physics-applications">Physics applications</h2>
<p>When the principles of seismic interferometry are used by physicists, they tend to be known as &ldquo;time-reversed acoustics&rdquo; (noting that seismic waves are technically very similar to acoustic waves; both techniques are also analogous but more distantly connected to optical interferometry). These techniques were developed separately in parallel initially, only being widely recognised as connected (though not exactly identical) in the 2000s. Time-reversed acoustics studies were able to progress differently to seismic interferometry studies, being able to demonstrate stable time-reversal of signals while geophysical results were still inconclusive on the process&rsquo;s stability<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Much of the early theory of this technique was pioneered by Mathias Fink. Applications for the theory were suggested or demonstrated in hydrodynamics, echo detection, medicine, and non-destructive sample testing.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> This included such practical goals as submarine and gallstone detection, medically-induced hyperthermia, and detecting small defects in the titanium-alloy used for jet engines and steel used for nuclear reactors. Evaluating the success of these applications is outside of the scope of this website, given their non-geophysical context.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-applications">Engineering applications</h2>
<p>When the principles of seismic interferometry are used in engineering applications, they may be referred to as seismic interferometry, time-reversed acoustics, or as &ldquo;SPatial AutoCorrelation method (SPAC)&rdquo;. Seismic interferometry has been used to reasonable effectiveness, for example, in measuring the motion of buildings<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and detecting buried water pipes.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> In these applications passive source interferometry must be used, to prevent civilian disturbances, though the properties of urban noise sources lead to some difficulties in analysis and stability of results. Time-reversed acoustics has been used for locating cracks in structures and focussing sound within rooms.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> SPAC typically uses microtremor / ambient noise sources in order to conduct cheap and non-disturbing near-subsurface urban imaging  for civil engineering developments.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Engineering and geophysics greatly intersect for the application of earthquake damage-mitigation, meaning cross-field collaboration on implementing these techniques in urban environments will be consistently beneficial.</p>

  <div class="box-content">

<p>This page consists of a summary of four different problems that seismic interferometry has recently begun to be applied to. There are many potential directions for the future development of seismic interferometry, this webpage is nowhere near comprehensive on the topic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One recently developed application of seismic interferometry has been mapping the height of the bedrock/soil interface, and wave velocity of soils.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Knowing the height of this interface is beneficial for underground project site investigations, and is required in reasonably high accuracy and resolution. Seismic interferometric techniques here were shown to measure these properties to the required degree on-site. These techniques come with the benefit of being relatively quick and cheap, and not requiring surveyors get permission to dig as many boreholes during the surveying stage. However, as this is most relevant in urban environments, assumptions need to be made around the passive seismic signals being generated during the surveying. The variance of this by site is a significant limitation to the development of this highly sensitive near-surface technique.</p>
<p>Seismic interferometry has also been applied to monitoring groundwater fluctuations, with the added benefit over well and satellite measurements of depth resolution, as well as typically higher spatial and temporal resolution.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Given the reliance of many communities on groundwater, being able to cheaply monitor it over large areas and time periods provides critical information for policy decisions regarding it. Changes in the wave velocity through the aquifer depend on the groundwater present there, such that travel-time techniques (combined with some passive interferometry data) can be used. Due to its four-dimensional resolution, seismic interferometry currently appears the most promising technique for comprehensive aquifer modelling and monitoring.</p>
<p>Developments have also occurred for using passive artificial noise sources for seismic interferometric imaging, notably traffic and train patterns.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> In order to effectively use these sources, the previously-held assumption of uncorrelation of noise sources needed to be reconsidered. The benefit of using these noise sources is in being able to repeatedly survey land areas near enough to urban development to have traffic connections, without the disruptions associated with a typical active source approach. Train sources in particular have a wide range of generated frequencies, leading to more reliable final images, though these techniques are clearly spatially limited in their applicability. Analysing this type of data through neural networks has so far been shown as cheap and feasible for use in real-time monitoring applications, though it does require reasonable knowledge of the vibration&rsquo;s source.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Neural networks have also been applied outside of traffic data processing, for instance in determining the Green&rsquo;s function from a passive source dataset more generally, using as little as five minutes of recorded (currently synthetic) data.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> For this goal, the neural networks were used primarily to address the limitations in randomness of source position and timing, instead implicitly relating the data and output. The model investigated in this paper benefitted from an additional input of source directions, when dealing with an inhomogeneous distribution. This application is still in its very early stages, but could prove promising as a data analysis technique as it becomes more developed.</p>
