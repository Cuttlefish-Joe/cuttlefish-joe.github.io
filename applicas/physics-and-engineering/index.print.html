<h2 id="physics-applications">Physics applications</h2>
<p>When the principles of seismic interferometry are used by physicists, they tend to be known as &ldquo;time-reversed acoustics&rdquo; (noting that seismic waves are technically very similar to acoustic waves; both techniques are also analogous but more distantly connected to optical interferometry). These techniques were developed separately in parallel initially, only being widely recognised as connected (though not exactly identical) in the 2000s. Time-reversed acoustics studies were able to progress differently to seismic interferometry studies, being able to demonstrate stable time-reversal of signals while geophysical results were still inconclusive on the process&rsquo;s stability<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Much of the early theory of this technique was pioneered by Mathias Fink. Applications for the theory were suggested or demonstrated in hydrodynamics, echo detection, medicine, and non-destructive sample testing.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> This included such practical goals as submarine and gallstone detection, medically-induced hyperthermia, and detecting small defects in the titanium-alloy used for jet engines and steel used for nuclear reactors. Evaluating the success of these applications is outside of the scope of this website, given their non-geophysical context.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-applications">Engineering applications</h2>
<p>When the principles of seismic interferometry are used in engineering applications, they may be referred to as seismic interferometry, time-reversed acoustics, or as &ldquo;SPatial AutoCorrelation method (SPAC)&rdquo;. Seismic interferometry has been used to reasonable effectiveness, for example, in measuring the motion of buildings<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and detecting buried water pipes.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> In these applications passive source interferometry must be used, to prevent civilian disturbances, though the properties of urban noise sources lead to some difficulties in analysis and stability of results. Time-reversed acoustics has been used for locating cracks in structures and focussing sound within rooms.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> SPAC typically uses microtremor / ambient noise sources in order to conduct cheap and non-disturbing near-subsurface urban imaging  for civil engineering developments.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Engineering and geophysics greatly intersect for the application of earthquake damage-mitigation, meaning cross-field collaboration on implementing these techniques in urban environments will be consistently beneficial.</p>
