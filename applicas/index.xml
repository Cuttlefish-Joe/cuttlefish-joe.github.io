    <title>Applications : Seismic Interferometry</title>
    <link>https://cuttlefish-joe.github.io/applicas/index.html</link>
    <description>This section contains an overview of the ways that seismic interferometry has been applied in various geophysical fields. It also summarises how similar techniques developed in parallel have been applied in related fields, such as ultrasonic physics and civil engineering. Some of the applications currently in development are also given an overview.</description>

      <description>Seismic interferometry as a technique has an array of applications within geophysics. It is also deeply interlinked with other fields of study, including physics and engineering. In fact, the principles developed theoretically as seismic interferometry (then referring specifically to passive source methods, known as daylight scattering) saw their first successful applications in the field of helioseismology, investigating the internal structure of the sun.1&#xA;(Rickett and Claerbout, 1999) ↩︎</description>

      <description>Exploration applications The main goal of seismic interferometry is creating images of the subsurface structure and properties in an investigated area. This is plainly of interest to exploration geophysicists, who need to identify valuable reservoirs and monitor them as development proceeds. Seismic interferometry can be used for estimating appropriate locations for resources1, as well as monitoring them during resource extraction.2 Seismic interferometry can also be used during the extraction stages, with the waves produced by a tunnel-boring machine processed through the technique in order to improve fracture predictions.</description>

      <description>Physics applications When the principles of seismic interferometry are used by physicists, they tend to be known as “time-reversed acoustics” (noting that seismic waves are technically very similar to acoustic waves; both techniques are also analogous but more distantly connected to optical interferometry). These techniques were developed separately in parallel initially, only being widely recognised as connected (though not exactly identical) in the 2000s. Time-reversed acoustics studies were able to progress differently to seismic interferometry studies, being able to demonstrate stable time-reversal of signals while geophysical results were still inconclusive on the process’s stability1 Much of the early theory of this technique was pioneered by Mathias Fink.</description>

      <description>Info&#xD;This page consists of a summary of four different problems that seismic interferometry has recently begun to be applied to. There are many potential directions for the future development of seismic interferometry, this webpage is nowhere near comprehensive on the topic.&#xA;One recently developed application of seismic interferometry has been mapping the height of the bedrock/soil interface, and wave velocity of soils.1 Knowing the height of this interface is beneficial for underground project site investigations, and is required in reasonably high accuracy and resolution.</description>
