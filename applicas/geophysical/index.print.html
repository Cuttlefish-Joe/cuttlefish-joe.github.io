<h2 id="exploration-applications">Exploration applications</h2>
<p>The main goal of seismic interferometry is creating images of the subsurface structure and properties in an investigated area. This is plainly of interest to exploration geophysicists, who need to identify valuable reservoirs and monitor them as development proceeds. Seismic interferometry can be used for estimating appropriate locations for resources<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, as well as monitoring them during resource extraction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Seismic interferometry can also be used during the extraction stages,  with the waves produced by a tunnel-boring machine processed through the technique in order to improve fracture predictions.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It has also been suggested for use in locating miners trapped after collapse events.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Seismic interferometry is a well-suited tool for these exploration applications, given that any inferences drawn from the data will be later validated if exploration takes place. The technique here is useful as a relatively quick and cheap way of surveying sites in detail, for potential exploration ventures. The miner location application, while an important task, is not as well suited to seismic interferometry. This is because many other noise sources could be active at the same time the technique is used, making the active source data more noisy than desired; as well as the potential for the miners to be unable to reach / operate the stations assigned for interferometric modelling.</p>
<h2 id="mapping-applications">Mapping applications</h2>
<p>Seismic interferometry is also widely applied for creating larger-scale maps of earth&rsquo;s structure, and wave velocity (particularly surface wave velocity, as these waves tend to remain as coherent noise across long surface distances).  This is typically, but not always done with earthquake seismology frameworks. For instance, seismic interferometry is used to predict surface wave signals without the use of a velocity model for the region, which can then be used to filter this data and observe other noise sources as well. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Accurate models of surface wave velocity in an area are also beneficial for earthquake damage-mitigation activities. Seismic interferometry can be applied to micro-earthquake records to determine local geological structures in areas without nearby seismological activity, as well as comparatively cheaply monitor long-term subsurface processes in these areas.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The increasing presence of large (portable) seismometer arrays, able to monitor large areas not typically targeted for observation with relatively high density data, provides an opportunity for passive seismic interferometry on a very large scale.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Alternatively, non-earthquake noise sources such as industrial noise have been used to map wave velocities in an area.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> The benefit of seismic interferometry in these scenarios is their ability to collect data at all; these wide-scale surveys end up providing subsurface structure estimates for regions that would not normally be focused on when using conventional seismic techniques. However, it is then harder to verify these models, which are additionally likely to be of lower quality due to the potentially quite weak signals being analysed. With the large array applications this is mitigated somewhat, due to the huge number of potential signal correlations that can be conducted across the whole array, a strength for seismic interferometry&rsquo;s use with them. Manmade noise sources, though intriguing for use with this technique, remain reasonably location-dependent in their applicability.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other applications</h2>
<p>Seismic interferometry has been applied to visualising specific geological features as well. For instance, it has been successfully used in detecting the Mohorovičić discontinuity (crust-mantle boundary) depth<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, and in detecting a subducting plate.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Here, the technique serves as a source of cheap additional information about geological features, that can be compared to and used to enhance existing datasets from other methodologies. Seismic interferometry has also been used to model and monitor volcanic activity, able to detect changes of 0.1% of the velocity, with a one-day temporal resolution.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> While the velocity resolution is good, the temporal resolution produced in this study means the technique is of limited use as an early-warning system, at its current level of development. Though the technique inherently benefits from longer sampling times, as equipment grows more sensitive this may be able to partially offset the reduction in sampling time required for use as an early-warning system. The technique has also been applied to lunar seismic data, using passive data generated from the thermal gradients induced by the sun on the moon&rsquo;s surface.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> This provides more insight into the very sparse dataset of lunar subsurface measurements, however the signals identified were very weak, the datasets to analyse very limited, and the external knowledge of lunar geology lacking, meaning interpreting this data is made more difficult.</p>
