<p>This page consists of a summary of four different problems that seismic interferometry has recently begun to be applied to. There are many potential directions for the future development of seismic interferometry, this webpage is nowhere near comprehensive on the topic.</p>
</div>

<p>One recently developed application of seismic interferometry has been mapping the height of the bedrock/soil interface, and wave velocity of soils.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Knowing the height of this interface is beneficial for underground project site investigations, and is required in reasonably high accuracy and resolution. Seismic interferometric techniques here were shown to measure these properties to the required degree on-site. These techniques come with the benefit of being relatively quick and cheap, and not requiring surveyors get permission to dig as many boreholes during the surveying stage. However, as this is most relevant in urban environments, assumptions need to be made around the passive seismic signals being generated during the surveying. The variance of this by site is a significant limitation to the development of this highly sensitive near-surface technique.</p>
<p>Seismic interferometry has also been applied to monitoring groundwater fluctuations, with the added benefit over well and satellite measurements of depth resolution, as well as typically higher spatial and temporal resolution.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Given the reliance of many communities on groundwater, being able to cheaply monitor it over large areas and time periods provides critical information for policy decisions regarding it. Changes in the wave velocity through the aquifer depend on the groundwater present there, such that travel-time techniques (combined with some passive interferometry data) can be used. Due to its four-dimensional resolution, seismic interferometry currently appears the most promising technique for comprehensive aquifer modelling and monitoring.</p>
<p>Developments have also occurred for using passive artificial noise sources for seismic interferometric imaging, notably traffic and train patterns.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> In order to effectively use these sources, the previously-held assumption of uncorrelation of noise sources needed to be reconsidered. The benefit of using these noise sources is in being able to repeatedly survey land areas near enough to urban development to have traffic connections, without the disruptions associated with a typical active source approach. Train sources in particular have a wide range of generated frequencies, leading to more reliable final images, though these techniques are clearly spatially limited in their applicability. Analysing this type of data through neural networks has so far been shown as cheap and feasible for use in real-time monitoring applications, though it does require reasonable knowledge of the vibration&rsquo;s source.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Neural networks have also been applied outside of traffic data processing, for instance in determining the Green&rsquo;s function from a passive source dataset more generally, using as little as five minutes of recorded (currently synthetic) data.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> For this goal, the neural networks were used primarily to address the limitations in randomness of source position and timing, instead implicitly relating the data and output. The model investigated in this paper benefitted from an additional input of source directions, when dealing with an inhomogeneous distribution. This application is still in its very early stages, but could prove promising as a data analysis technique as it becomes more developed.</p>
