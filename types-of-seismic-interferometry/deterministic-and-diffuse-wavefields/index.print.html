<p>The two different scenarios where seismic interferometry can be applied to datasets are known as deterministic and diffuse wavefield interferometry, or alternatively as active and passive interferometry.</p>
<p>Deterministic wavefield interferometry, or active interferometry, is used on datasets generated from single, often manmade, seismic signals. The signal origins can be manually separated in time and space to ensure even distributions and adequate coverage, while maintaining diffuse wavefield conditions. This technique is typically used by exploration seismologists, with the budgetary requirements to make such surveys, and in locations where large explosions are unlikely to cause civil unrest, though some earthquake data can also be processed this way.</p>
<p>Diffuse wavefield interferometry, or passive interferometry, instead is used on datasets generated from long-time recordings of background seismic noise, such as teleseisms and microseisms,  or even nearby traffic. Here, the signal origins are typically unknown, with the assumption taken that the data is recorded over long enough that their temporal and spatial origins are approximately random and uncorrelated, to maintain diffuse wavefield conditions. This technique is more commonly used by earthquake seismologists, so that earthquake imaging can be conducted in locations apart from plate boundaries. It is also used by engineers, working in civil construction projects where active sources would be inappropriate (see the applications section).</p>
<p>Both techniques use a similar mathematical basis, with the main difference being that for active sources, each recorded response must be correlated separately before being summed to create a single image, while for passive sources, a single correlation can be performed on the dataset.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
