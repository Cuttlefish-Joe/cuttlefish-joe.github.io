<p>The main goal of seismic interferometry is to improve our imaging of the (reflective surfaces within the) subsurface, through increasing its resolution, letting it cover a greater spatial area, and through allowing us to determine useful properties such as wave velocity. Seismic interferometry does not generate any new data, it simply uses the seismic readings recorded at various instruments (normally geophones), and extracts information otherwise regarded as noise.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Its main strength as a technique is that it is data-driven; it relies solely on sensor position data and their seismic readings, with no prior knowledge of the subsurface structure or seismic source timing / locations required.</p>

<p>Like other types of interferometry, seismic interferometry relies on interfering two wave signals (here in the form of seismic readings), typically recording the same event/s. Mathematically, this is done by either correlation (autocorrelation when comparing a signal to itself, cross-correlation when comparing two) or convolution, as detailed later in this section. The events of interest recorded in the signals are the reflections of the wave off of the different subsurface layers (or the underside surface of the earth), with their different mechanical properties. The wave signals can be collected actively or passively, leading to deterministic and diffuse wavefield interferometry, as detailed later in this section. Both techniques require the assumption of a diffuse wavefield - where all the different wave vectors are uncorrelated, and carry the same amount of energy. This can be justified by some combination of: measuring signals from a random distribution of uncorrelated noise sources (predominant for diffuse wavefield data); or assuming the medium is heterogeneous enough that for late times (an event&rsquo;s coda), the initial wave signal has scattered enough that elements are propagating in every direction with equal energy (predominant for deterministic wavefield data).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Some of the other benefits of seismic interferometry for imaging activities include: the static data from the investigated receivers can be ignored (as this process examines the phase difference between them rather than their raw data); the processed waveform sources appear closer to the imaged areas, meaning distorting areas don&rsquo;t have to be considered in the wave propagation paths, increasing the imaging resolution; many different datasets can cheaply be compared over the same area, enhancing noisy signals; and the area being imaged can be extended, through considered use of transforms. The technique comes with drawbacks however: the mathematical formulations of the technique require three-component recording (e.g. measurements in the x, y, and z direction) which is often not done, lowering the result accuracy; they also assume a wide aperture of sources and receivers in the investigated area, which is not always practical in the field, again lowering result accuracy; and they assume that the investigated medium is non-attenuative (elastic), which is often not the case. While corrections can be applied for these (and several other error sources for the technique), these can introduce their own error to the data.<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="establishing-the-behaviour-of-greens-function">Establishing the behaviour of Green&rsquo;s Function</h2>
<p>In the frequency domain, for an arbitrary linear acoustic medium of constant density, Green&rsquo;s function will satisfy the Helmholtz equation (differentiation with respect to coordinates of g):</p>
\[ (\nabla^2 + k^2)G(g|s) = -\delta(s-g) \]
<p>This has two independent solutions: the causal outgoing Green&rsquo;s function $G(g|s)$, and the acausal/time-reversed incoming Green&rsquo;s function $G(g|s)^{*}$. For a homogeneous medium, with a harmonically oscillating point source signal origin, Green&rsquo;s function can take the form:</p>
\[ G(g|s) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} , r = | g - s | \]
<p>The high-frequency asymptotic for a smooth velocity distribution version of this is:</p>
\[ G(g|s) = A(g,s)e^{i\omega\tau_{gs}} \]
<p>Where A accounts for spreading effects and $\tau$ is the wave travel-time, both of which can be solved for.</p>
<h2 id="deriving-expressions-for-seismic-interferometric-correlation-and-convolution">Deriving expressions for seismic interferometric correlation and convolution</h2>
<p>Using the assumptions established above, the governing Helmholtz equations for convolution and correlation are:</p>
\[ (\nabla^2 + k^2)G(x|A) = -\delta(x - A) ; (\nabla^2 + k_0^2)G_0(x|B) = -\delta(x-B) \]
\[ (\nabla^2 + k^2)G(x|A) = -\delta(x - A) ; (\nabla^2 + k_0^2)G(x|B)^{*} = -\delta(x-B) \]
<p>Respectively, where $k_0$ is the value of k for $v_0$, A and B are interior point sources to boundary S, and x may be interior or on the boundary. Multiplying both expressions of each set by each other and subtracting the second Green&rsquo;s functions produces:</p>
\[ G_0(x|B)\nabla^2G(x|A) - G(x|A)\nabla^2G_0(x|B) = G(x|A)\delta(x-B) - G_0(x|B)\delta(x-A) \]
\[ G(x|B)^{*} \nabla^2G(x|A) - G(x|A) \nabla^2G(x|B)^{*} = G(x|A)\delta(x-B) - G(x|B)^{*}\delta(x-A) \]
<p>Using product rule:</p>
\[ G(x|A)\nabla^2G_0(x|B) = \nabla \cdot [G(x|A)\nabla G_0(x|B)] - \nabla G(x|A) \cdot \nabla G_0(x|B) \]
\[ G_0(x|B)\nabla^2G(x|A) = \nabla \cdot [G_0(x|B)\nabla G(x|A)] - \nabla G_0(x|B) \cdot \nabla G(x|A) \]
\[ G(x|A)\nabla^2G(x|B)^{*} = \nabla \cdot [G(x|A)\nabla G(x|B)^{*}] - \nabla G(x|A) \cdot \nabla G(x|B)^{*} \]
\[ G(x|B)^{*} \nabla^2G(x|A) = \nabla \cdot [G(x|B)^{*}\nabla G(x|A)] - \nabla G(x|B)^{*} \cdot \nabla G(x|A) \]
<p>Integrating these expressions over the volume enclosed by S (using Gauss&rsquo; theorem):</p>
\[ G(B|A) - G_0(A|B) = \int_s [G_0(x|B) \frac{\partial G(x|A)}{\partial n_x} - G(x|A)\frac{\partial G_0(x|B)}{\partial n_x}]d^2 x \]
\[ G(B|A) - G(A|B)* = \int_s [G(x|B)^{*} \frac{\partial G(x|A)}{\partial n_x} - G(x|A)\frac{\partial G(x|B)^{*}}{\partial n_x}]d^2 x \]
<p>With $\frac{\partial G_0(x|B)}{\partial n_x} = \hat{n} \cdot \nabla G_0(x|B)$ and $\frac{\partial G(x|B)^{*}}{\partial n_x} = \hat{n} \cdot \nabla G(x|B)^{*}$ for B not located on S, respectively.</p>
<p>The seismic convolution expression is called as such as it is composed of spectral products, which are convolutions in the time domain. This leads to the spectral phases summing, creating a larger overall travel-time, meaning convolution is useful to predict the later reflections of waves from their earlier data. This expression is the origin for many forward modelling processes, with notably the Born forward modelling process being derived from the second step of the process, to find:</p>
\[ \delta G(B|A) \approx \omega^2 \int_V G_0(B|x) 2sl_0(x)\delta sl(x) G_0(x|A) d^3 x \]
<p>Where $sl(x) = \frac{1}{v(x)}$ as the slowness field.</p>
<p>The correlation expression is instead composed of an integration of spectrums being multiplied by spectrum complex conjugates, which become correlations in the time domain. This leads to the spectral phases subtracting, creating a smaller overall travel-time, and allowing correlation to predict the earlier reflections of waves from their later data (redatuming the data to be closer to the targeted source). The left-hand-side of the final expression can also be written as $2i Im(G(B|A)) = G(B|A) - G(B|A)^{*}$, such that $g(B,t|A,0)$ (the causal Green&rsquo;s function defining the modelled propagation) can be found through an inverse Fourier transform. Applying the far field approximation, using the form of Green&rsquo;s function given earlier, this relation can be further expressed as:</p>
\[ 2i Im(G(B|A)) \approx 2ik \int_{s_0} G(x|B)^{*} G(x|A) d^2 x \]
<p>An expression key to time-reversed acoustics, daylight imaging (see applications), and diffuse wavefield modelling in particular.  Its physical nature can be better understood by applying a stationary phase integration, such that only the paths close to the path of least time contribute to the final expression. For $G(x|A) = e^{i \omega \tau_{ A y0 x}}$ as the path $x \rightarrow y0 \rightarrow A$ and $G(x|B) = e^{i \omega \tau_{x B}}$ as the path $x \rightarrow B$ (see image),  this produces the relation:</p>
\[ Im(G(B|A)) \approx \alpha ke^{i\omega \tau_{ A y0 B}} \]
<p>Which represents the path $B \rightarrow y0 \rightarrow A$, the third frame of the image. Here, $ \alpha = e^{i \pi /4} \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{\omega |\phi(x^{*})^{"}|} } $ is an asymptotic coefficient.</p>

<h2 id="signal-migration">Signal migration</h2>
<p>In order to find the distribution of reflective surfaces in an investigated area, the collected seismic signals need to be inverted; however doing this directly is computationally expensive. An approximate version of this, known as migration, can be performed using the Born modelling equation (see above). This relocates the arrival of reflected signals back to the locations where they reflected. That equation can be rewritten as:</p>
\[  D(g|s) \approx \omega^2 \int_V G_0(g|x)m(x)G_0(x|s)d^3 x \]
<p>Where $D(g|s)$ is the raw reflected data in the frequency domain, and $m(x) = 2sl(x)\delta s(x)$ is the weighted reflectivity distribution that we want to find. This can be condensed to $d = Lm$, where $d = D(g|s)$, $m = m(x)$ and L represents the rest of the expression, known as the Born forward modelling operator. By discretising the space being investigated into N cells, this expression can be written as:</p>
\[ d_i = \sum^N_{j=1} L_{ij}m_{j} \]
<p>Where i is over the coordinates for s and g, and j is over the coordinates of the reflective locations. This system of equations is typically overdetermined (many more equations than unknown variables) and inconsistent (the equations do not all agree precisely), so a least squares solution can be found to solve the  system, minimising $\epsilon$ for:</p>
\[ \epsilon = \frac{1}{2} \sum_j r_j^{*} r_j \]
<p>Where $r_j$ is the residual component of the jth equation. The ideal system model can be found by setting the derivative of $\epsilon$ with respect to the unknown model parameters m to zero. This produces:</p>
\[ \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial m_n} = \sum_j Real(L_{jn}^{*} (Lm - d)_j ) = 0 \]
<p>For the real parameters. Combining this with the similar expression for the imaginary model parameters, and using the approximation of (<em>Claerbout and Abma, 1992</em>) that $L^{*}L$ is diagonally dominant over $L^{*}d$, produces:</p>
\[ m_i \approx \frac{ (L^{*} d)_i}{ (L^{*}L)_{ii}} \]
<p>An approximation that holds for wide and dense sampling of sources and receivers. Normalising, this produces:</p>
\[ m_j = \sum_{i=1}^M L_{ij}^{*}d_i \]
<p>So that the subsurface reflective locations can be estimated using the reflected data in the frequency domain and the (adjoint) of the forward modelling operator. This is the most important formula of exploration seismic imaging, and can be fully expanded as:</p>
\[ m(x) = \int^\infty_{-\infty} \int_g \int_s \omega^2 (G_0(g|x)^{*} D(g|s))(G_0(x|S))^{*} d^2sd^2gd\omega \]
<p>Where the integration over $\omega$ stacks together the images determined from different frequencies.</p>
<p>There are two main interferometric imaging procedures: to redatum raw data to a location closer to the imaged area, thus reducing the model-associated errors of standard seismic imaging through the smaller distance; and to use collected data wholly or partially in place of the Green&rsquo;s functions in the expression above. Both provide (to different extents) the benefits discussed on this website, and the use of either technique will be situation-dependent.</p>

<h1 id="deterministic-and-diffuse-wavefields">Deterministic and Diffuse Wavefields</h1>

<p>The two different scenarios where seismic interferometry can be applied to datasets are known as deterministic and diffuse wavefield interferometry, or alternatively as active and passive interferometry.</p>
<p>Deterministic wavefield interferometry, or active interferometry, is used on datasets generated from single, often manmade, seismic signals. The signal origins can be manually separated in time and space to ensure even distributions and adequate coverage, while maintaining diffuse wavefield conditions. This technique is typically used by exploration seismologists, with the budgetary requirements to make such surveys, and in locations where large explosions are unlikely to cause civil unrest, though some earthquake data can also be processed this way.</p>
<p>Diffuse wavefield interferometry, or passive interferometry, instead is used on datasets generated from long-time recordings of background seismic noise, such as teleseisms and microseisms,  or even nearby traffic. Here, the signal origins are typically unknown, with the assumption taken that the data is recorded over long enough that their temporal and spatial origins are approximately random and uncorrelated, to maintain diffuse wavefield conditions. This technique is more commonly used by earthquake seismologists, so that earthquake imaging can be conducted in locations apart from plate boundaries. It is also used by engineers, working in civil construction projects where active sources would be inappropriate (see the applications section).</p>
<p>Both techniques use a similar mathematical basis, with the main difference being that for active sources, each recorded response must be correlated separately before being summed to create a single image, while for passive sources, a single correlation can be performed on the dataset.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the more common types of seismic interferometry is transforming Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) data into Single Well Profiling (SWP) data, via a correlation of wave signals. This is typically a deterministic wavefield interferometric technique, using receivers set up within a borehole, which are established specifically for imaging the area. As part of this process, the wave source is redatumed to be much closer to the target within the borehole (the source is in fact also placed inside the borehole). This closeness can increase the imaging resolution of the final experimental model.<sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>On top of the standard benefits offered by seismic interferometry, this process allows for super-resolution imaging; where due to the efficient use of otherwise restrictively noisy data, the reflective surfaces in the area could be imaged to a resolution beyond the diffraction limit of an analogous homogeneous medium, significantly enlarging the effective recording aperture of the setup and allowing better estimation of Green&rsquo;s function.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Along with the standard limitations offered by seismic interferometry, this particular transformation requires data be collected within a borehole / well, which can be quite expensive to do, and is not an option in all locations.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> VSP datasets are thus also less common to find available for analysis second-hand.</p>

<p>VSP data can also be transformed into Surface Seismic Profiling (SSP) data, by either correlation or convolution of wave signals.</p>
<p>The correlation transforming approach comes with the standard benefits of seismic interferometry (including a significant increase in the illuminated subsurface area), however is typically formulated in two dimensions and so, to get a 3D image around a particular location, the correlations must be performed at each angle to generate slices of the three-dimensional whole. <sup id="fnref4:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This process can be extended to transform from VSP signals to SSP back to different VSP signals, which can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the imaging done from the VSP data (due to there being more (virtual) points available). This technique also allows interpolation of Ocean Bottoms Seismic survey (OBS)  data so the profiles are more detailed.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> However, some of the techniques to conduct these transformations rely on modelling appropriate green&rsquo;s functions, which can induce errors due to not being solely dependent on the collected data.</p>
<p>The convolution transforming approach is less immediately beneficial, as the virtual sources are created further from the receivers than they real sources, and the process still suffers from  the standard seismic interferometry limitations. However, it allows for clear combination of VSP and SSP datasets collected at the same site, through convolving the VSP data to appear at the surface in the same locations, so the datasets can be directly compared. This process also transforms OBS data (collected by attaching an active source to a boat and measuring it via receivers on the ocean floor) into standard seafloor SSP data.<sup id="fnref5:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Overall, the benefit of using VSP-collected data is in it being typically of higher resolution (as the wave signals pass through the highly attenuating near-surface strata less often), and containing more reliable information at depth. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> However, SSP-collected data is much more common, so converting into this form allows direct comparison to significantly more comprehensive datasets around the world.</p>

<p>Correlation can also be used to transform SSP data that has reflected off the surface of the earth multiple times (multiples), into either lower order multiples or primaries (where the wave has only hit the surface once), which can then be used to investigate these earlier parts of the wave&rsquo;s transit. This comes with the benefit of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the imaging, as more energy is being investigated in any one area due to more (virtual) signals having been created. This also means a larger subsurface area can be imaged, with each reflection of the wave off of earth&rsquo;s surface potentially a new virtual wave source.<sup id="fnref7:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This enhances the imaging&rsquo;s spatial resolution, and allows interpolation of data if there are enough reflective surfaces in the area.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>This technique can also be used on surface waves data collected at surface sensor arrays. While exploration geologists tend to view these as noise and attempt to suppress them, earthquake geologists have been able to use this technique to predict and invert them within datasets, visualising the crustal surface wave velocity distribution (and thus important properties of the crustal structure) in that area.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>However, along with the standard interferometric limitations, this procedure is relatively new and thus its sources of error are less thoroughly quantified than for some of these other techniques.<sup id="fnref8:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SSP data can also be transformed into VSP data, which can be transformed into SWP data as earlier discussed. This transformation is particularly useful for attempting to image underneath salt bodies, which are quite effective shields to seismic waves, making data collected beneath them using normal methods weak and defocused. Here, surface data is redatumed to be underneath the salt bodies (assuming the VSP transformed data can penetrate below them), so that the wave signal arrivals from off the salt bodies come from deeper virtual sources, avoiding their distortive effects. Due to the number of steps involved in this transformation there are numerous opportunities for error to be introduced.<sup id="fnref9:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="travel-time-interferometry">Travel Time Interferometry</h1>

<p>Although most seismic interferometry looks at transforming wave signals (which can be visualised as seismometer records) from one form to another, interferometry can also be used to investigate the wave travel-time between locations, using very similar principles. These travel times can be used to find the velocity distributions in the medium between locations, knowing their distances apart.</p>
<p>Travel-time interferometry can be done between different data profiling types as was discussed in Interferometric transforms. However, instead of examining the entire seismic signal, this process is only concerned with the arrival times of the recorded events. It relies on Fermat&rsquo;s principle; or the principle of least time. This principle states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waves of a given frequency will traverse the path between two points that takes the least time.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that, although a wave will spread out from a source in all directions, its energy will be concentrated around the shortest-time path to any given end location, with more distantly-angled arrivals interfering destructively and not contributing much to the final wave arrival. Therefore, if a number of different signals are added up at a given end location, the constructively interfering signals will tend towards the least-time path (&ldquo;specular path&rdquo; in some sources).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> These least-time paths can then be compared to the direct waves at various locations, in order to find the difference in arrival times between these locations and the end location, allowing determination of the travel-times and thus velocity distributions in those areas.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
