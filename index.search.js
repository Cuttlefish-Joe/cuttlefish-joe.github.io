    "content": "The main goal of seismic interferometry is to improve our imaging of the (reflective surfaces within the) subsurface, through increasing its resolution, letting it cover a greater spatial area, and through allowing us to determine useful properties such as wave velocity. Seismic interferometry does not generate any new data, it simply uses the seismic readings recorded at various instruments (normally geophones), and extracts information otherwise regarded as noise.1 Its main strength as a technique is that it is data-driven; it relies solely on sensor position data and their seismic readings, with no prior knowledge of the subsurface structure or seismic source timing / locations required.\n2\nLike other types of interferometry, seismic interferometry relies on interfering two wave signals (here in the form of seismic readings), typically recording the same event/s. Mathematically, this is done by either correlation (autocorrelation when comparing a signal to itself, cross-correlation when comparing two) or convolution, as detailed later in this section. The events of interest recorded in the signals are the reflections of the wave off of the different subsurface layers (or the underside surface of the earth), with their different mechanical properties. The wave signals can be collected actively or passively, leading to deterministic and diffuse wavefield interferometry, as detailed later in this section. Both techniques require the assumption of a diffuse wavefield - where all the different wave vectors are uncorrelated, and carry the same amount of energy. This can be justified by some combination of: measuring signals from a random distribution of uncorrelated noise sources (predominant for diffuse wavefield data); or assuming the medium is heterogeneous enough that for late times (an event’s coda), the initial wave signal has scattered enough that elements are propagating in every direction with equal energy (predominant for deterministic wavefield data).3\n4\nSome of the other benefits of seismic interferometry for imaging activities include: the static data from the investigated receivers can be ignored (as this process examines the phase difference between them rather than their raw data); the processed waveform sources appear closer to the imaged areas, meaning distorting areas don’t have to be considered in the wave propagation paths, increasing the imaging resolution; many different datasets can cheaply be compared over the same area, enhancing noisy signals; and the area being imaged can be extended, through considered use of transforms. The technique comes with drawbacks however: the mathematical formulations of the technique require three-component recording (e.g. measurements in the x, y, and z direction) which is often not done, lowering the result accuracy; they also assume a wide aperture of sources and receivers in the investigated area, which is not always practical in the field, again lowering result accuracy; and they assume that the investigated medium is non-attenuative (elastic), which is often not the case. While corrections can be applied for these (and several other error sources for the technique), these can introduce their own error to the data.4\n(Wapenaar et al., 2010) ↩︎\n(He et al., 2007) ↩︎\n(van Wijk, 2006) ↩︎\n(Schuster, 2009) ↩︎ ↩︎",

    "content": "Exploration applications The main goal of seismic interferometry is creating images of the subsurface structure and properties in an investigated area. This is plainly of interest to exploration geophysicists, who need to identify valuable reservoirs and monitor them as development proceeds. Seismic interferometry can be used for estimating appropriate locations for resources1, as well as monitoring them during resource extraction.2 Seismic interferometry can also be used during the extraction stages, with the waves produced by a tunnel-boring machine processed through the technique in order to improve fracture predictions.3 It has also been suggested for use in locating miners trapped after collapse events.4 Seismic interferometry is a well-suited tool for these exploration applications, given that any inferences drawn from the data will be later validated if exploration takes place. The technique here is useful as a relatively quick and cheap way of surveying sites in detail, for potential exploration ventures. The miner location application, while an important task, is not as well suited to seismic interferometry. This is because many other noise sources could be active at the same time the technique is used, making the active source data more noisy than desired; as well as the potential for the miners to be unable to reach / operate the stations assigned for interferometric modelling.\nMapping applications Seismic interferometry is also widely applied for creating larger-scale maps of earth’s structure, and wave velocity (particularly surface wave velocity, as these waves tend to remain as coherent noise across long surface distances). This is typically, but not always done with earthquake seismology frameworks. For instance, seismic interferometry is used to predict surface wave signals without the use of a velocity model for the region, which can then be used to filter this data and observe other noise sources as well. 5 Accurate models of surface wave velocity in an area are also beneficial for earthquake damage-mitigation activities. Seismic interferometry can be applied to micro-earthquake records to determine local geological structures in areas without nearby seismological activity, as well as comparatively cheaply monitor long-term subsurface processes in these areas.6 The increasing presence of large (portable) seismometer arrays, able to monitor large areas not typically targeted for observation with relatively high density data, provides an opportunity for passive seismic interferometry on a very large scale.7 Alternatively, non-earthquake noise sources such as industrial noise have been used to map wave velocities in an area.8 The benefit of seismic interferometry in these scenarios is their ability to collect data at all; these wide-scale surveys end up providing subsurface structure estimates for regions that would not normally be focused on when using conventional seismic techniques. However, it is then harder to verify these models, which are additionally likely to be of lower quality due to the potentially quite weak signals being analysed. With the large array applications this is mitigated somewhat, due to the huge number of potential signal correlations that can be conducted across the whole array, a strength for seismic interferometry’s use with them. Manmade noise sources, though intriguing for use with this technique, remain reasonably location-dependent in their applicability.\nOther applications Seismic interferometry has been applied to visualising specific geological features as well. For instance, it has been successfully used in detecting the Mohorovičić discontinuity (crust-mantle boundary) depth9, and in detecting a subducting plate.10 Here, the technique serves as a source of cheap additional information about geological features, that can be compared to and used to enhance existing datasets from other methodologies. Seismic interferometry has also been used to model and monitor volcanic activity, able to detect changes of 0.1% of the velocity, with a one-day temporal resolution.11 While the velocity resolution is good, the temporal resolution produced in this study means the technique is of limited use as an early-warning system, at its current level of development. Though the technique inherently benefits from longer sampling times, as equipment grows more sensitive this may be able to partially offset the reduction in sampling time required for use as an early-warning system. The technique has also been applied to lunar seismic data, using passive data generated from the thermal gradients induced by the sun on the moon’s surface.12 This provides more insight into the very sparse dataset of lunar subsurface measurements, however the signals identified were very weak, the datasets to analyse very limited, and the external knowledge of lunar geology lacking, meaning interpreting this data is made more difficult.\n(Lakings et al., 2006) ↩︎\n(Hohl and Mateeva, 2006) ↩︎\n(Poletto and Petronio, 2006) ↩︎\n(Hanafy et al., 2009) ↩︎\n(Dong et al., 2006) ↩︎\n(Scherbaum, 1987) ↩︎\n(Gerstoft et al., 2006) ↩︎\n(Miyazawa et al., 2008) ↩︎\n(Kumar and Bostock, 2006) ↩︎\n(Shragge et al., 2006) ↩︎\n(Sens-Schönfelder and Wegler, 2006) ↩︎\n(Larose et al., 2005) ↩︎",

Seismic interferometry has been used to reasonable effectiveness, for example, in measuring the motion of buildings3, and detecting buried water pipes.4 In these applications passive source interferometry must be used, to prevent civilian disturbances, though the properties of urban noise sources lead to some difficulties in analysis and stability of results.

There are many potential directions for the future development of seismic interferometry, this webpage is nowhere near comprehensive on the topic.\nOne recently developed application of seismic interferometry has been mapping the height of the bedrock/soil interface, and wave velocity of soils.1 Knowing the height of this interface is beneficial for underground project site investigations, and is required in reasonably high accuracy and resolution. Seismic interferometric techniques here were shown to measure these properties to the required degree on-site. These techniques come with the benefit of being relatively quick and cheap, and not requiring surveyors get permission to dig as many boreholes during the surveying stage. However, as this is most relevant in urban environments, assumptions need to be made around the passive seismic signals being generated during the surveying. The variance of this by site is a significant limitation to the development of this highly sensitive near-surface technique.\nSeismic interferometry has also been applied to monitoring groundwater fluctuations, with the added benefit over well and satellite measurements of depth resolution, as well as typically higher spatial and temporal resolution.2 Given the reliance of many communities on groundwater, being able to cheaply monitor it over large areas and time periods provides critical information for policy decisions regarding it. Changes in the wave velocity through the aquifer depend on the groundwater present there, such that travel-time techniques (combined with some passive interferometry data) can be used. Due to its four-dimensional resolution, seismic interferometry currently appears the most promising technique for comprehensive aquifer modelling and monitoring.\nDevelopments have also occurred for using passive artificial noise sources for seismic interferometric imaging, notably traffic and train patterns.3 In order to effectively use these sources, the previously-held assumption of uncorrelation of noise sources needed to be reconsidered. The benefit of using these noise sources is in being able to repeatedly survey land areas near enough to urban development to have traffic connections, without the disruptions associated with a typical active source approach. Train sources in particular have a wide range of generated frequencies, leading to more reliable final images, though these techniques are clearly spatially limited in their applicability. Analysing this type of data through neural networks has so far been shown as cheap and feasible for use in real-time monitoring applications, though it does require reasonable knowledge of the vibration’s source.4 Neural networks have also been applied outside of traffic data processing, for instance in determining the Green’s function from a passive source dataset more generally, using as little as five minutes of recorded (currently synthetic) data.5 For this goal, the neural networks were used primarily to address the limitations in randomness of source position and timing, instead implicitly relating the data and output. The model investigated in this paper benefitted from an additional input of source directions, when dealing with an inhomogeneous distribution. This application is still in its very early stages, but could prove promising as a data analysis technique as it becomes more developed.\n(Zhang et al., 2021) ↩︎\n(Mao et al., 2022) ↩︎\n(Liu et al., 2021 (Yujin)) ↩︎\n(Liu et al., 2021 (Lu)) ↩︎\n(Sun and Demanet, 2023) ↩︎",

For a homogeneous medium, with a harmonically oscillating point source signal origin, Green’s function can take the form:\n\\[ G(g|s) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{e^{ikr}}{r} , r = | g - s | \\] The high-frequency asymptotic for a smooth velocity distribution version of this is:\n\\[ G(g|s) = A(g,s)e^{i\\omega\\tau_{gs}} \\] Where A accounts for spreading effects and $\\tau$ is the wave travel-time, both of which can be solved for.\nDeriving expressions for seismic interferometric correlation and convolution Using the assumptions established above, the governing Helmholtz equations for convolution and correlation are:\n\\[ (\\nabla^2 + k^2)G(x|A) = -\\delta(x - A) ; (\\nabla^2 + k_0^2)G_0(x|B) = -\\delta(x-B) \\] \\[ (\\nabla^2 + k^2)G(x|A) = -\\delta(x - A) ; (\\nabla^2 + k_0^2)G(x|B)^{*} = -\\delta(x-B) \\] Respectively, where $k_0$ is the value of k for $v_0$, A and B are interior point sources to boundary S, and x may be interior or on the boundary. Multiplying both expressions of each set by each other and subtracting the second Green’s functions produces:\n\\[ G_0(x|B)\\nabla^2G(x|A) - G(x|A)\\nabla^2G_0(x|B) = G(x|A)\\delta(x-B) - G_0(x|B)\\delta(x-A) \\] \\[ G(x|B)^{*} \\nabla^2G(x|A) - G(x|A) \\nabla^2G(x|B)^{*} = G(x|A)\\delta(x-B) - G(x|B)^{*}\\delta(x-A) \\] Using product rule:\n\\[ G(x|A)\\nabla^2G_0(x|B) = \\nabla \\cdot [G(x|A)\\nabla G_0(x|B)] - \\nabla G(x|A) \\cdot \\nabla G_0(x|B) \\] \\[ G_0(x|B)\\nabla^2G(x|A) = \\nabla \\cdot [G_0(x|B)\\nabla G(x|A)] - \\nabla G_0(x|B) \\cdot \\nabla G(x|A) \\] \\[ G(x|A)\\nabla^2G(x|B)^{*} = \\nabla \\cdot [G(x|A)\\nabla G(x|B)^{*}] - \\nabla G(x|A) \\cdot \\nabla G(x|B)^{*} \\] \\[ G(x|B)^{*} \\nabla^2G(x|A) = \\nabla \\cdot [G(x|B)^{*}\\nabla G(x|A)] - \\nabla G(x|B)^{*} \\cdot \\nabla G(x|A) \\] Integrating these expressions over the volume enclosed by S (using Gauss’ theorem):\n\\[ G(B|A) - G_0(A|B) = \\int_s [G_0(x|B) \\frac{\\partial G(x|A)}{\\partial n_x} - G(x|A)\\frac{\\partial G_0(x|B)}{\\partial n_x}]d^2 x \\] \\[ G(B|A) - G(A|B)* = \\int_s [G(x|B)^{*} \\frac{\\partial G(x|A)}{\\partial n_x} - G(x|A)\\frac{\\partial G(x|B)^{*}}{\\partial n_x}]d^2 x \\] With $\\frac{\\partial G_0(x|B)}{\\partial n_x} = \\hat{n} \\cdot \\nabla G_0(x|B)$ and $\\frac{\\partial G(x|B)^{*}}{\\partial n_x} = \\hat{n} \\cdot \\nabla G(x|B)^{*}$ for B not located on S, respectively.\nThe seismic convolution expression is called as such as it is composed of spectral products, which are convolutions in the time domain. This leads to the spectral phases summing, creating a larger overall travel-time, meaning convolution is useful to predict the later reflections of waves from their earlier data. This expression is the origin for many forward modelling processes, with notably the Born forward modelling process being derived from the second step of the process, to find:\n\\[ \\delta G(B|A) \\approx \\omega^2 \\int_V G_0(B|x) 2sl_0(x)\\delta sl(x) G_0(x|A) d^3 x \\] Where $sl(x) = \\frac{1}{v(x)}$ as the slowness field.\nThe correlation expression is instead composed of an integration of spectrums being multiplied by spectrum complex conjugates, which become correlations in the time domain. This leads to the spectral phases subtracting, creating a smaller overall travel-time, and allowing correlation to predict the earlier reflections of waves from their later data (redatuming the data to be closer to the targeted source). The left-hand-side of the final expression can also be written as $2i Im(G(B|A)) = G(B|A) - G(B|A)^{*}$, such that $g(B,t|A,0)$ (the causal Green’s function defining the modelled propagation) can be found through an inverse Fourier transform. Applying the far field approximation, using the form of Green’s function given earlier, this relation can be further expressed as:\n\\[ 2i Im(G(B|A)) \\approx 2ik \\int_{s_0} G(x|B)^{*} G(x|A) d^2 x \\] An expression key to time-reversed acoustics, daylight imaging (see applications), and diffuse wavefield modelling in particular. Its physical nature can be better understood by applying a stationary phase integration, such that only the paths close to the path of least time contribute to the final expression. For $G(x|A) = e^{i \\omega \\tau_{ A y0 x}}$ as the path $x \\rightarrow y0 \\rightarrow A$ and $G(x|B) = e^{i \\omega \\tau_{x B}}$ as the path $x \\rightarrow B$ (see image), this produces the relation:\n\\[ Im(G(B|A)) \\approx \\alpha ke^{i\\omega \\tau_{ A y0 B}} \\] Which represents the path $B \\rightarrow y0 \\rightarrow A$, the third frame of the image. Here, $ \\alpha = e^{i \\pi /4} \\sqrt{ \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega |\\phi(x^{*})^{\"}|} } $ is an asymptotic coefficient.\nSignal migration In order to find the distribution of reflective surfaces in an investigated area, the collected seismic signals need to be inverted; however doing this directly is computationally expensive. An approximate version of this, known as migration, can be performed using the Born modelling equation (see above). This relocates the arrival of reflected signals back to the locations where they reflected. That equation can be rewritten as:\n\\[ D(g|s) \\approx \\omega^2 \\int_V G_0(g|x)m(x)G_0(x|s)d^3 x \\] Where $D(g|s)$ is the raw reflected data in the frequency domain, and $m(x) = 2sl(x)\\delta s(x)$ is the weighted reflectivity distribution that we want to find. This can be condensed to $d = Lm$, where $d = D(g|s)$, $m = m(x)$ and L represents the rest of the expression, known as the Born forward modelling operator. By discretising the space being investigated into N cells, this expression can be written as:\n\\[ d_i = \\sum^N_{j=1} L_{ij}m_{j} \\] Where i is over the coordinates for s and g, and j is over the coordinates of the reflective locations. This system of equations is typically overdetermined (many more equations than unknown variables) and inconsistent (the equations do not all agree precisely), so a least squares solution can be found to solve the system, minimising $\\epsilon$ for:\n\\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_j r_j^{*} r_j \\] Where $r_j$ is the residual component of the jth equation. The ideal system model can be found by setting the derivative of $\\epsilon$ with respect to the unknown model parameters m to zero. This produces:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial m_n} = \\sum_j Real(L_{jn}^{*} (Lm - d)_j ) = 0 \\] For the real parameters. Combining this with the similar expression for the imaginary model parameters, and using the approximation of (Claerbout and Abma, 1992) that $L^{*}L$ is diagonally dominant over $L^{*}d$, produces:\n\\[ m_i \\approx \\frac{ (L^{*} d)_i}{ (L^{*}L)_{ii}} \\] An approximation that holds for wide and dense sampling of sources and receivers. Normalising, this produces:\n\\[ m_j = \\sum_{i=1}^M L_{ij}^{*}d_i \\] So that the subsurface reflective locations can be estimated using the reflected data in the frequency domain and the (adjoint) of the forward modelling operator. This is the most important formula of exploration seismic imaging, and can be fully expanded as:\n\\[ m(x) = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} \\int_g \\int_s \\omega^2 (G_0(g|x)^{*} D(g|s))(G_0(x|S))^{*} d^2sd^2gd\\omega \\] Where the integration over $\\omega$ stacks together the images determined from different frequencies.\nThere are two main interferometric imaging procedures: to redatum raw data to a location closer to the imaged area, thus reducing the model-associated errors of standard seismic imaging through the smaller distance; and to use collected data wholly or partially in place of the Green’s functions in the expression above. Both provide (to different extents) the benefits discussed on this website, and the use of either technique will be situation-dependent.",

This is typically a deterministic wavefield interferometric technique, using receivers set up within a borehole, which are established specifically for imaging the area. As part of this process, the wave source is redatumed to be much closer to the target within the borehole (the source is in fact also placed inside the borehole). This closeness can increase the imaging resolution of the final experimental model.1\nOn top of the standard benefits offered by seismic interferometry, this process allows for super-resolution imaging; where due to the efficient use of otherwise restrictively noisy data, the reflective surfaces in the area could be imaged to a resolution beyond the diffraction limit of an analogous homogeneous medium, significantly enlarging the effective recording aperture of the setup and allowing better estimation of Green’s function.2\nAlong with the standard limitations offered by seismic interferometry, this particular transformation requires data be collected within a borehole / well, which can be quite expensive to do, and is not an option in all locations.3 VSP datasets are thus also less common to find available for analysis second-hand.\nVSP to SSP transforms 1\nVSP data can also be transformed into Surface Seismic Profiling (SSP) data, by either correlation or convolution of wave signals.\nThe correlation transforming approach comes with the standard benefits of seismic interferometry (including a significant increase in the illuminated subsurface area), however is typically formulated in two dimensions and so, to get a 3D image around a particular location, the correlations must be performed at each angle to generate slices of the three-dimensional whole. 1 This process can be extended to transform from VSP signals to SSP back to different VSP signals, which can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the imaging done from the VSP data (due to there being more (virtual) points available). This technique also allows interpolation of Ocean Bottoms Seismic survey (OBS) data so the profiles are more detailed.4 However, some of the techniques to conduct these transformations rely on modelling appropriate green’s functions, which can induce errors due to not being solely dependent on the collected data.\nThe convolution transforming approach is less immediately beneficial, as the virtual sources are created further from the receivers than they real sources, and the process still suffers from the standard seismic interferometry limitations. However, it allows for clear combination of VSP and SSP datasets collected at the same site, through convolving the VSP data to appear at the surface in the same locations, so the datasets can be directly compared. This process also transforms OBS data (collected by attaching an active source to a boat and measuring it via receivers on the ocean floor) into standard seafloor SSP data.1\nOverall, the benefit of using VSP-collected data is in it being typically of higher resolution (as the wave signals pass through the highly attenuating near-surface strata less often), and containing more reliable information at depth. 5 However, SSP-collected data is much more common, so converting into this form allows direct comparison to significantly more comprehensive datasets around the world.\nSSP to SSP transforms 1\nCorrelation can also be used to transform SSP data that has reflected off the surface of the earth multiple times (multiples), into either lower order multiples or primaries (where the wave has only hit the surface once), which can then be used to investigate these earlier parts of the wave’s transit. This comes with the benefit of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the imaging, as more energy is being investigated in any one area due to more (virtual) signals having been created. This also means a larger subsurface area can be imaged, with each reflection of the wave off of earth’s surface potentially a new virtual wave source.1 This enhances the imaging’s spatial resolution, and allows interpolation of data if there are enough reflective surfaces in the area.6\nThis technique can also be used on surface waves data collected at surface sensor arrays. While exploration geologists tend to view these as noise and attempt to suppress them, earthquake geologists have been able to use this technique to predict and invert them within datasets, visualising the crustal surface wave velocity distribution (and thus important properties of the crustal structure) in that area.7\nHowever, along with the standard interferometric limitations, this procedure is relatively new and thus its sources of error are less thoroughly quantified than for some of these other techniques.1\nSSP data can also be transformed into VSP data, which can be transformed into SWP data as earlier discussed. This transformation is particularly useful for attempting to image underneath salt bodies, which are quite effective shields to seismic waves, making data collected beneath them using normal methods weak and defocused. Here, surface data is redatumed to be underneath the salt bodies (assuming the VSP transformed data can penetrate below them), so that the wave signal arrivals from off the salt bodies come from deeper virtual sources, avoiding their distortive effects. Due to the number of steps involved in this transformation there are numerous opportunities for error to be introduced.1\n(Schuster, 2009) ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎\n(Derode et al., 1995) ↩︎\n(US EPA, 2020) ↩︎\n(Dong and Schuster, 2007) ↩︎\n(Lines and Newrick, 2004) ↩︎\n(Berkhout and Verschuur, 2006) ↩︎\n(Gersoft et al., 2006) ↩︎",

These travel times can be used to find the velocity distributions in the medium between locations, knowing their distances apart.\nTravel-time interferometry can be done between different data profiling types as was discussed in Interferometric transforms. However, instead of examining the entire seismic signal, this process is only concerned with the arrival times of the recorded events. It relies on Fermat’s principle; or the principle of least time. This principle states that:\nWaves of a given frequency will traverse the path between two points that takes the least time.1\nThis means that, although a wave will spread out from a source in all directions, its energy will be concentrated around the shortest-time path to any given end location, with more distantly-angled arrivals interfering destructively and not contributing much to the final wave arrival. Therefore, if a number of different signals are added up at a given end location, the constructively interfering signals will tend towards the least-time path (“specular path” in some sources).2 These least-time paths can then be compared to the direct waves at various locations, in order to find the difference in arrival times between these locations and the end location, allowing determination of the travel-times and thus velocity distributions in those areas.3\n(Raymond, 2021) ↩︎\n(Sneider, 2004) ↩︎\n(Schuster, 2009) ↩︎",

Many purpose-built interferometers will use this fact, and generate a single wave to be recorded at multiple receivers, so that the initial wavelength and phase are the same for all the detected signals. They can measure variations in intensity of the superimposed signals to find the phase difference, and ultimately the path difference (difference in distance travelled reaching one receiver compared to the other) between the receivers measuring the wave signals.2 Other techniques might have a known path difference, and aim to find the travel-time difference for the two paths, thus finding the velocity of the wave signal in the investigated medium. Others still might compare the entire recorded wave signals, to determine other properties about the material between the receivers, through inverse modelling. Ultimately, interferometry is just a technique to be used to extract more information out of wave signals through comparison, than can be gotten by analysing a single signal alone.\n(LIGO Caltech, 2020) ↩︎\n(Raja and Barron, 2016) ↩︎",

    "content": "\rInfo\rThis practical example aims to highlight how interfering two wave signals can amplify information regarding the difference in paths between the two signals. It uses the easy visualisation opportunities provided by working with visible light to demonstrate this. Here, the information is the difference in path length, but this does not have to be the case for interferometry, as discussed in the general overview.\nMichelson interferometers To understand the physical principles behind interferometry, waves must be recognised as objects with phases attached to them. A generic wave E at travelling in time t and direction x can be written mathematically as:\n\\[ E(x,t) = E_0 e^{i (kx - \\omega t)} \\] Where $E_0$ serves as an initial amplitude, k as a spatial frequency, and $\\omega$ as a temporal frequency. At a specific value for x and t (a specific location and time), this can be simplified to:\n\\[ E = E_0 e^{i \\phi} \\] Where $\\phi$ is known as the phase of the wave. This means, when comparing two waves, one of which travelled some additional distance/time compared to the other, the difference between the two waves can be notated as a phase difference; an additional $e^{i\\phi}$ term in the expression of the longer-travelled wave.\nIn a Michelson interferometer, an initial wave signal (laser beam) is generated at location A. This wave travels to the beamsplitter at B, where part of the wave is reflected and travels length $L_1$, while the rest of the wave is transmitted and travels length $L_2$. These distances are different, and so give the part of the wave that travelled that distance the phases $e^{i\\phi_1}$ and $e^{i\\phi_2}$ respectively. These wave signals are both reflected off of mirrors at $C_1$ and $C_2$, and are rejoined at the beamsplitter, where they will travel to the receiving surface at D. Here, the optical signals get projected as light upon the surface, and will create circular fringes of light and dark bands, where the two phases interfere constructively (the difference in distances travelled is $n\\lambda$ for integer n and wavelength $\\lambda$) and destructively (the difference in distances is $(n+\\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$), respectively. By creating directional disturbances, such as bumping the table closer to one path than the other, the path difference between the two beams can be briefly changed, which manifests as a change in the pattern of fringes appearing on the surface. Seeing a fringe appear (or disappear) indicates the difference in distance between the two paths has changed on the order of the wavelength of the light; on the order of hundreds of nanometres.\nInformation about the reflectivity of the beamsplitter the signal travelled through can be found by analysing the intensity of the final output beam, though the equipment for doing this was not available for this example. Note that this process assumes a constant wavelength for the wave signal throughout the process. This assumption is held generally across different branches of interferometry.\nA slowed-down video of the change in fringe patterns upon pressing on the table the interferometer was set up on can be found here.1 Another, showing the change from jumping up and down near the table can be found here, and a third showing the change from walking around the table can be found here. All three videos show changes to the fringing pattern as the interferometer paths are disturbed. These changes all appear oscillatory, showing the effect of the continued aftershock vibrations through the table on the interferometer distance setup. From this it can be seen that impulses near the source or receivers are able to disturb the travel of the wave signals, creating small changes that are amplified to a much greater precision than would be seen if only looking at one signal – only observing the reflected or transmitted wavelength, we would not be able to observe changes on the orders of hundreds of nanometres. The changes seen are coming only from the difference in path between the two wave signals, the actual initial state of the system (the initial fringe arrangements and intensity) don’t factor into the understanding of the changes taking place.\nMany thanks to ANU Physics technical officers Dr Mika Kohonen and Dr Dije Wang for their assistance in providing access to the equipment needed to build the optical interferometer. ↩︎",
