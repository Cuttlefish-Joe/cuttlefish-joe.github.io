    <title>Greens Function : Seismic Interferometry</title>
    <link>https://cuttlefish-joe.github.io/glossary/greens-function/index.html</link>
    <description>A Green’s function is a system’s response to an impulsive point source.1 That is, it is the influence of a point source at one given location or time, on a different location or time. Mathematically, it can be found as G in:&#xA;\[ L u(x) = f(x) \] \[ u(x) = \int_\Omega G(x, y) f(y) dy \] With $u(x)$ as the response at x to source function $f(x)$ with domain $\Omega$, with y a dummy integration variable and L a linear differential operator (basically just meaning the left hand side of the first equation is some differential equation).</description>
