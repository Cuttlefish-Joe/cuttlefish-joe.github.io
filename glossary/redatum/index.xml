    <title>Redatum : Seismic Interferometry</title>
    <link>https://cuttlefish-joe.github.io/glossary/redatum/index.html</link>
    <description>Redatuming data is a numerical process, moving seismic sources or receivers from their initial acquisition positions, into virtual locations from their reflectivity history / potential. This process can simplify the seismic signals, if the receiver is redatumed to beneath a complex overburden, for example. Traditionally the process was completed using velocity distribution models, which limited its accuracy. Seismic interferometry innovates on this, relying only on recorded wave data (including higher-order reflections), which can then be correlated and summed over in order to determine more reliable experimental results.</description>
