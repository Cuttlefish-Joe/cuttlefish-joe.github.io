    <title>Borehole : Seismic Interferometry</title>
    <link>https://cuttlefish-joe.github.io/glossary/borehole/index.html</link>
    <description>Boreholes are wells or test holes drilled into the ground for geological investigations. Different probes can be lowered into these boreholes to gather information such as lithology, density, permeability and porosity, water quality, electric and thermal conductivity, radioactivity, and magnetisation.1 One of their benefits is in allowing multiple readings to be taken under the same conditions, allowing easy combination and comparison of data.2&#xA;(Roach, 2024) ↩︎&#xA;(New York Water Science Center, 2018) ↩︎</description>
